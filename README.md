# 👋 Hey, I'm Shubraj Salgotra

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a **software developer** by day, and a curious **builder** by night.  
Currently experimenting with ideas at the edge of **tech, AI, and human behaviour**.  
I like turning thoughts into tools — sometimes fun, sometimes useful, often both.

### 💼 What I do

- 🖥️ Building web products with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Firebase**, and **LLMs**
- 🤖 Exploring Generative AI, automation, and creative agent workflows
- 🧠 Trying to connect dots between **people**, **systems**, and **possibility**

### 🌱 Philosophy

> “Don’t announce. Don’t explain. Just build.”
